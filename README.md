# EI Assignments Repository

This repository contains assignments for the Engineering Innovation course.

## Assignments

### [Assignment 1: MindSpark Neo Learning Platform](./assignment1/)
A Java application demonstrating six design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Command, Decorator, Adapter) through an educational platform simulation.

### [Assignment 2: Smart Home System](./assignment2/)
A comprehensive Java application demonstrating multiple design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Proxy, Observer, Command) in a smart home automation system with security features and automation rules.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository contains Java applications that demonstrate various design patterns through practical, real-world scenarios. Each assignment showcases different combinations of design patterns in unique contexts:

- **Assignment 1**: Educational platform simulation with learning management features
- **Assignment 2**: Smart home automation system with security and automation capabilities

## Design Patterns Demonstrated Across Assignments

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** - Ensures single instances of critical system components
- **Factory** - Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic

### Structural Patterns  
- **Adapter** - Connects incompatible systems and interfaces
- **Decorator** - Adds functionality to objects dynamically
- **Proxy** - Provides controlled access to sensitive operations

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer** - Enables event-driven communication between components
- **Command** - Encapsulates operations for undo functionality and automation

## How to Run Each Assignment

## Learning Objectives

These assignments demonstrate how design patterns solve real-world software engineering challenges:

- **Code Reusability**: Patterns promote reusable, maintainable code
- **System Architecture**: Show how patterns work together in complex systems  
- **Problem Solving**: Illustrate practical applications beyond academic examples
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate industry-standard software design principles

Each assignment includes detailed documentation, compilation instructions, and example usage scenarios to help understand the practical value of design patterns in software development.
